# Exclusively Dark (ExDark) Image Dataset

Updated on June 1, 2019 (added codes for low-light image enhancement using Gaussian Process)

Released on May 29, 2018

## Description

* In order to facilitate a new object detection and image enhancement research, we introduce the Exclusively Dark (ExDark) dataset [(CVIU 2019)](http://cs-chan.com/doc/cviu.pdf). The Exclusively Dark (ExDARK) dataset is a collection of 7,363 low-light images from very low-light environments to twilight (i.e 10 different conditions) with 12 object classes (as to PASCAL VOC) annotated on both image class level and local object bounding boxes.

* Now available, codes for low-light image enhancement using Gaussian Process for features retrieval. [(SPIC 2019)](http://cs-chan.com/doc/SPIC2019.pdf)
